## Framingham-Heartrate-Prediction
Framingham Study is a population-based, observational cohort study that was initiated by the United States Public Health Service in 1948 to prospectively investigate the epidemiology and risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
        I used logistic regression to predict heart rate rate and also found accuracy.
